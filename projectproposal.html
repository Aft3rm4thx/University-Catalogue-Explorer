We feel as though this project will both benefit our target audience as well as our experience and customer relationship. While it gives them an extremely useful tool to project schedules and possible graduation dates, it also helps us with experience in the industry.

Problem Statement:
Assist students and academic advisers in classes, majors, minors, concentrations, and organize this data into one central hub and create this as a SaaS for universities.
Target Audience: Current and future students enrolled in universities/colleges
Why is this an important problem
Why is it better than existing technologies
Many universities lack software to allow students to efficiently view their curriculum, this would provide an easy to access solution that would be able to branch multiple universities to allow students from all over to obtain the same information in one central place. 
Why would a business buy this solution
A university that provides open and easy to use methods for students to view and evaluate the classes they&#8217;ll need to take during their program would have a competitive advantage over many other universities. The Student is the customer, and ultimately you&#8217;re trying to sell them a product. If it is easier for the student to decide what they need, they&#8217;ll be more willing to participate. 
What good things will come from your solution; what bad things won&#8217;t happen as a result of your solution.
Good things will consist of a new piece of software making students and academic advisers lives easier.  Bad things will consist of not having an easy system to work with and students and academic advisers being frustrated with class schedules and possible missing classes.

Project Description:
The solution will consist of three main parts, a web front end to act as an interface between the user and the system, web services that act as an intermediary between the user application and the database, and database that will be used to store and retrieve data. The user will be able to view the current, past, and projected course catalogue for a given university, and sort their curriculum by major, minor, class, and professor. The user will also be able to create mock-up schedules, and provide publicly visible feedback on professors and classes. 
Our solution takes an approach that is more geared towards the student being able to get detailed information about the courses required by their program. It will also give students the opportunity to evaluate their experience in classes in a manner that is publicly available to their peers. While some universities may prefer to keep information like that under wraps, it is important in maintaining a healthy level of customer satisfaction between universities and their students. A university that is more able to match the needs of their customers, may perform better in the long run. 
We will implement our solution via web page with web design and HTML standards. The web page will interact with web services, written in ASP.net + C#, that will retrieve information from a database that will operate using either Microsoft SQL Server or MySQL. 
Technologies you want to work with:
At the beginning of development, yes we will be limited to technology.  As development furthers and iterations are met, more technology can be utilized I.E. mobile applications, software, etc.
What are you technologies of choice?
Web page
ASP.net + C#
SQL Server or MySQL(?)
IIS
Mobile devices (later in development when web page is finished and polished)
